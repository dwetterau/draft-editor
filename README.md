# draft-editor [WIP]
A custom Meteor + React component for rich text editing with Draft.js

## Disclaimer:
There are no tests for this codebase. This codebase is a WIP (work in progress) so use at your own risk.

Also understand that I might abandon this or make breaking changes at any
time. I mainly created this repo to easily make it a submodule for multiple
of my other side projects :).

I'll add more docs later if people care.

## Usage:
Include the component on your page.
<DraftEditor ...props />

Refer to the proptypes in the `DraftEditor.jsx` for more.
